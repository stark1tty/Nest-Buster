## This script recurses through a given directory to find nested tags in your markdown notes and replaces them with individual tags. 
### Example: #tag1/tag2/tag3 will be replaced with #tag1, #tag2, and #tag3
## Please make sure to back up your files before running this script as it will make changes in place.
